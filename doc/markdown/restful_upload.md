## RESTful Upload Element - #restful_upload {}

  The button element produces an HTML `<input type=file>` element. The input
  element represents a file-choose dialog.  When the `#restful_submit` element
  from the same `#restful_form` is clicked, the chosen file will be uploaded to
  the server.

  To fetch the content of the uploaded file, you'll have to retrieve the
  uploaded file directly from `SimpleBridge` (as demonstrated below)

### Usage

```erlang
   #restful_upload { iname = upload},

   %% later on return
   Bridge = wf_context:bridge(),
   UploadedFiles = sbw:post_files(Bridge),
   %% ...
```

### Attributes
